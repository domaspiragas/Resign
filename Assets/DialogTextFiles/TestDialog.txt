Normally this would be where we explain how to play the game...
but...
We don't have much time, so I'll just tell you very quickly.
A = Move Left, D = Move Right, Space = Jump, Shift = Roll, Left Mouse = Ranged Attack, Right Mouse = Melee Attack, Tab = Toggle between swapping Melee and Ranged, Q = Toggle Selected weapon left, E = Toggle Selected Weapon Right, F = Interact button
Got that? 
No?
Uhh.. Sorry, I've got to go. Have fun!
